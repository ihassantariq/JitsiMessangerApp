# JitsiMessangerApp
Jitsi Meet Mobile App with features:

Jitsi Server Chatting Video Calling Capture Image  
Need some one already have base code with this feature and modify to fit with my requirement to save time. 
The App must develop by Xamarin and can build to iOS and Anrdoid. 
The Server side must setup separate installation on our server systemn (that mean NO USE EXTRA SERVICE like https://www.pubnub.com/, should deploy WebRTC on our server).  
Will have long job with this project, so please apply if you think you can do that help me.  My Time Zone is UTC+7. It will help more if we same TimeZone.
